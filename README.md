# slides3e -- PoC for presentation of pdf slides as a journey
slides3d runs on electron.js, three.js is used for rendering the scene and pdf.js is used to handle pdfs.

By default, the file ./presentations/example.pdf is read in main.js. 

The terrain is based on Perlin noise. All slides are faded in, so there is plenty of room for creativity here.

Low probability of further commits..
